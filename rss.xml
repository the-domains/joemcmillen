            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Jazz-Style Management: What Music Can Teach Us About Leadership</h1><p>Create the framework and let the team improvise. Managing people is hard.

Management skills are intangible and subjective.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d8b93ea2362b7b588a5417211063d6fa31076bc9.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>3 Reasons You Need An Accountabilibuddy</h1><p>Who holds you accountable? If you're like most people, the answer is nobody. Correct that, most people hold themselves accountable, which is just another way of saying nobody. After seven years of leadership coaching, and 41 years of living, I've learned that human beings are very bad at holding themselves accountable to accomplishing long-term goals.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/24c1632917c652297de394372a5922b1c14e1fb9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Rationale The purpose of categorizing is to eliminate redundancies by collapsing related items into clusters or chunks (a scientific term). A label or term that captures the title for each cluster can be more easily re-used in matrices and other visual displays....</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2e129e9e8f3c2f76b9f03f1b837ff571f83b0f5f.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>10 Lessons in Zen Leadership Practiced by Legendary Coach Phil Jackson</h1><p>What makes a good leader whether it's a boss, or a coach, or a parent?
